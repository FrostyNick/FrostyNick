### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and SQL databases.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, Lua, Bash, Python, C++, and several other coding experiences.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to snowboard and ice skate.
- ğŸ“« Reach me by my email (on my profile location) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogucki-nicholas/).
- ğŸ“‹ There's a lot of code I should upload to GitHub. Maybe one day...
- ğŸ‘€ I've created userstyles in the past. Check them out [here](https://userstyles.world/user/frostynick).
