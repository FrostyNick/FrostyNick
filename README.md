## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- Move description below to personal website + in a way that doesn't include this generic template? -->

#### Currently...
- ðŸ•“ Work and college.
- ðŸŒ± Learning about p5.js and Networking.
- ðŸ”¨ Working on Rhythm Swipe game.

#### Other things you may want to know
- ðŸ’­ Ask me about game development, Lua, Rust, Bash, Python, C++, and several other tools.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to snowboard and ice skate.
- ðŸ“« Reach me by creating an issue.
- ðŸ“‹ There's a lot of code I should upload. Maybe one day...
- ðŸ”­ I've created CSS userstyles in the past such as a [YouTube anti-distraction](https://userstyles.world/style/1651/youtube-anti-distraction) style before I knew that [Unhook](https://unhook.app/ "Unhook - Remove YouTube Recommended Videos and More") existed. Other styles are on [my userstyles.org profile](https://userstyles.org/users/639166). Note this requires something to inject (CSS) user styles such as the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) extension.
