## Hi there!

<!--
Move description below to personal website + in a way that doesn't include this generic template?
Conversely, my website could automatically parse this website when there's new changes if that is efficiently possible?

#### At the moment
- ðŸ•“ Working at IT desk and looking into club leadership roles lately.
- ðŸŒ± Learning about [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) and Cybersecurity.

#### Other things you may want to know
- I've used [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) and [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) to automate textual actions in essays and code with Linux, Termux, and Windows. Check out my [nvim](https://github.com/FrostyNick/dotfiles/tree/main/.config/nvim) to get started on or learn more about vim/neovim. Feedback is welcome.
- Ask me about game development combined with Lua, p5.js (with [Rhythm Swipe](https://github.com/FrancisTR/Rhythm-Swipe)), Neovim, Love2D or Roblox.
- I've had experience with system configurations in Bash, ZSH, and Python.
- Programming languages include but are not limited to Rust, C++, Java, Javascript with audioContext, and much more.
- Primarily developing on the Linux Desktop with some Windows and MacOS knowledge.
- Fun fact: I like to snowboard and ice skate.
- There's a lot of code I should upload here. Maybe one day...
- I've created CSS userstyles in the past such as a [YouTube anti-distraction](https://userstyles.world/style/1651/youtube-anti-distraction) style before I knew that [Unhook](https://unhook.app/ "Unhook - Remove YouTube Recommended Videos and More") existed. Other styles are on [my userstyles.org profile](https://userstyles.org/users/639166). Note this requires something to inject (CSS) user styles such as the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) extension.

Here are some ideas to permanantly delete yourself empathetically and physically from GitHub:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on your parents.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to sleep 0.1% better.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the meaning of life.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with gambling away all my money.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no fun facts. They are all sad facts.
