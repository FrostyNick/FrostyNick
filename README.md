### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Note: My dotfiles repo has been privated due to security concerns. It will be public after further evaluating the situation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about p5.js and Networking.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, Lua, Rust, Bash, Python, C++, and several other tools.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to snowboard and ice skate.
- ðŸ“« Reach me by creating an issue.
- ðŸ“‹ There's a lot of code I should upload. Maybe one day...
- ðŸ”­ I've created css userstyles in the past such as a [YouTube anti-distraction](https://userstyles.world/style/1651/youtube-anti-distraction) style before I knew that [Unhook](https://unhook.app/ "Unhook - Remove YouTube Recommended Videos and More") exists. Other styles [here](https://userstyles.org/users/639166). Note this requires something to inject user styles / CSS such as the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) extension.
