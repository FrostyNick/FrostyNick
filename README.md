### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) and SQL databases.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about game development, Lua, Bash, Python, C++, and several other coding experiences.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like to snowboard and ice skate.
- ðŸ“« Reach me by my email (on my profile location) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogucki-nicholas/).
- ðŸ“‹ There's a lot of code I should upload to GitHub. Maybe one day...
- ðŸ‘€ I've created css userstyles in the past such as a [YouTube anti-distraction](https://userstyles.world/style/1651/youtube-anti-distraction) style. Other styles [here](https://userstyles.org/users/639166). Note this requires something to inject user styles. I personally recommend the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) extension.
